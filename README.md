### H3 Shui Restaurant |
This website is for a fictional steakhouse restaurant. It exists thanks to HTML5, Flexbox, SASS, and Javascript(ES6)/JQuery. Note that you can submit the reservation form to see the loading and success animations. 

### H3 Golf Handicap Calculator |
Written entirely with vanilla Javascript(ES6). This was a personal project to help me quickly gauge my average golf handicap after every 5 rounds.
