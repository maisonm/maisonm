This Github page hosts multiple static websites for my portfolio. Web applications for my portfolio are hosted with Heroku and will not be found hosted on this Github page. 

This is a brief overview of what is hosted here:

Shui Restaurant - This website is for a fictional steakhouse restaurant. It exists thanks to HTML5, Flexbox, SASS, and Javascript(ES6)/JQuery. Note that you can submit the reservation form to see the loading and success animations. 

Golf Handicap Calculator - Written entirely with vanilla Javascript(ES6). This was a personal project to help me quickly gauge my average golf handicap after every 5 rounds.
